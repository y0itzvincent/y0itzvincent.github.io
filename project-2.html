                <h2>Introduction</h2>
In this career simulation, you will use your newfound knowledge of vulnerability assessment and risk management to work through a problem. Using techniques learned in this bootcamp, you will examine and explain which tools and techniques to use for the best possible outcomes. Additionally, you will write a penetration testing report for your client that documents your findings.

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
Your deliverable for this career simulation should demonstrate an understanding of the following learning objectives. These objectives will be used for grading.

<h2>Vulnerabilities Assessment</h2>
Exhibit ethical hacking protocols to evaluate the security of and identify vulnerabilities in target systems, networks, or system infrastructure.
Perform vulnerability scanning using a variety of tools.
Use and configure tools to perform offensive security techniques.
Use modules within Metasploit and explain their purpose.
Establish Meterpreter sessions and explain how to use them.
Search for privilege escalation opportunities through lateral movement.
Apply the pass-the-hash technique to take advantage of flaws in NTLM authentication.
<h2>Interpersonal Skills</h2>
Develop constructive and cooperative working relationships.
Identify problems using a group approach and develop solutions based on a group consensus.
Apply active listening skills by using reflection, restatement, questioning, and clarification.
Convey information clearly, correctly, and succinctly.
Respond appropriately to positive and constructive feedback.
Reach agreements that promote mutual goals and interests.
<h2>Problem Solving</h2>
Observe and evaluate the outcomes of implementing solutions to assess the need for alternative approaches and to identify lessons learned.
Recall previously learned information that is relevant to the problem.
Use a security mindset to identify assets and security goals, potential adversaries and threats, and potential weaknesses.
Have sufficient inductive and deductive reasoning abilities to do the job successfully.
Use man pages to learn about unfamiliar commands or switches.
Search for online information and interact with websites and web applications.
Critically review, analyze, synthesize, compare, and interpret information.
<h2>Writing</h2>
Communicate thoughts, ideas, and information, which might include technical material, in a logical, organized, and coherent manner.
Tailor the content to the appropriate audience and purpose.
Analyze penetration reports and explain their purpose.
Scenario
Fullstack Academy has reviewed your teamâ€™s report and is satisfied with the results. Because your team did such a great job, they would like a follow-up penetration test with an isolated portion of the network that was not part of the original engagement. However, this isolated portion of the network has a small number of systems, so it does not make sense for your entire team to be involved with this follow-up engagement. Instead, your team has assigned you to complete the penetration test for this isolated network on your own, as you have proven yourself ready to handle this kind of engagement.

<h2>Rules of Engagement</h2>
You are authorized only to scan and attack systems that reside on the same /20 subnet on which your Kali instance resides (e.g., if the IP of your Kali instance is 172.31.6.161, you are only authorized to scan and attack systems on the 172.31.6.0/20 subnet).
No social engineering or client-side exploits are needed or permitted on this penetration test.
You are allowed to work with your classmates on this penetration test.
Everything you need to complete this test should be available to you on the systems already; there should be no need to download outside tools for this penetration test.
