                <h2>Introduction</h2>
In this career simulation, you will use your newfound knowledge of the Windows operating system and management techniques to solve a problem. This scenario is based on a real-life simulation using a fictional company and team members. Using techniques learned in this bootcamp, you will examine and explain which tools to use for the best possible outcomes. Additionally, you will write a runbook to document your findings.

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
Your deliverable for this career simulation should demonstrate an understanding of the following learning objectives. These objectives will be used for grading.

<h2>Asset and Inventory Management</h2>
Find, view, create, move, and delete files and directories.
Perform software asset inventory functions on Windows systems.
<h2>System Administration</h2>

Apply active listening skills by using reflection, restatement, questioning, and clarification.
Convey information clearly, correctly, and succinctly.
Respond appropriately to positive and constructive feedback.
Reach agreements that promote mutual goals and interests.
<h2>Problem-Solving</h2>
Observe and evaluate the outcomes of implementing solutions to assess the need for alternative approaches and to identify lessons learned.
Recall previously learned information that is relevant to the problem.
Use a security mindset to identify assets and security goals, potential adversaries and threats, and potential weaknesses.
Have sufficient inductive and deductive reasoning abilities to do the job successfully.
Search for online information and interact with websites and web applications.
Critically review, analyze, synthesize, compare, and interpret information.
<h2>Writing</h2>
Communicate thoughts, ideas, and information, which might include technical material, in a logical, organized, and coherent manner.
Tailor the content to the appropriate audience and purpose.
Explain the importance of reporting and documentation in forensics.
<h2>Scenario</h2>
As a new StackFull Software employee, you've been tasked to work alongside Damen, the IT Security Manager, to write a runbook for the IT Pre-onboarding process.

IT onboarding introduces and trains new hires in the technology they'll use in their day-to-day responsibilities. Before onboarding begins, however, the IT team needs to set up and ensure new hire technology is ready for their first day.
A runbook is a detailed "how-to" guide for completing a commonly repeated task or procedure within a company's IT operations process, like setting up a laptop for a new hire.
You have the unique experience of participating in IT onboarding and knowledge of Windows management that can help with this task! Complete each of the steps below using the server and DESKTOP-2 in your Unit 5: Windows VM, then write a runbook to complete the steps for all new hires moving forward.

<h2>Problem</h2>
Before you begin, decide:

Name of the new hire
Non-technical role at StackFull Software (i.e., recruiter, sales associate, social media associate)
Department they work in (i.e., HR, Sales, Marketing)
Read the steps below and discuss how each step may differ based on the permissions needed for your specific new hire.

<h2>Challenge 1</h2>
Join the computer to the domain (the domain name is contoso.com). The username/password is administrator/Pa$$w0rd.

<h2>Challenge 2</h2>
Switch to the server. Create a user for the new hire and set a password.

<h2>Challenge 3</h2>
Create a group with the department name and place the user in that group.

<h2>Challenge 4</h2>
Create a share on the server with the department name and share it only with people who belong to that department (read and write permissions). In the folder, create a text document called test.txt.

<h2>Challenge 5</h2>
Create an OU with the department's name and place the user, group, and computer in the OU. Attach a GPO to the OU you created.

<h2>Challenge 6</h2>
Edit the GPO and apply the following rules:

A message should appear whenever the computer starts (do not install unauthorized programs).
Prevent the user's access to CMD.
Add script to the user's login to map the share you created.
Disable the run command from the start menu.
<h2>Challenge 7</h2>
Check the Event Viewer on the server machine and write down the last successful login from your user. (Note: You must log in with the domain administrator account).

<h2>Challenge 8</h2>
Use PowerShell to check what the latest program installed on the computer was.

<h2>Challenge 9</h2>
Write a PowerShell script that gives a list of all running services and puts it in a file named running_services.txt.

<h2>Runbook</h2>
Damen would like you to write a runbook documenting your process for setting up a machine for new hires. Your runbook should include the following:

Introduction of what steps the runbook achieves
Procedure on how to complete steps, with visuals
